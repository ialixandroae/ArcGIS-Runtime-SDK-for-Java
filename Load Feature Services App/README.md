The app loads the data through the REST url, render it into the map and also provides info from the attribute table

##How it works

1. Paste a REST url into the Text Area 
2. Push 'Add Service' button
3. Change the basemap from the drop-down list of available basemaps
4. The data from the service loads into the map and in the table view
